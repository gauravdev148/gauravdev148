### Hi there, I'm Gaurav Dev! 👋

**Aspiring Researcher in Formal Methods & Safe AI**
I combine **Computer Science** with **Industrial Safety Standards** (NEBOSH/OSHA) to build trustworthy software for high-risk environments.

🔭 **Current Research Focus:**
* **Formal Verification:** How to mathematically prove that a "Permit to Work" system cannot reach an unsafe state.
* **Applied NLP:** Structuring ambiguous "Near-Miss" (Hiyari-Hatto) reports to predict construction accidents.

🌱 **Technical Background:**
* **Languages:** Python (Flask, Pandas), SQL, JavaScript.
* **Domain:** Industrial Safety (Advanced Diploma - Grade A).
* **Goal:** Joining a research lab to bridge the gap between ISO Safety Protocols and Software Reliability.
